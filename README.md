phorton1/ffmpeg
=========================

This is the **multi-tip** branch of my fork of the ffmpeg.org repository. This is also the "master" branch that will be gotten from bitbucket.

The version of this fork of ffmpeg is 2.7+.

This fork/branch is being done in order to implement *multi-fpcalc* builds.

More specifically, this multi-tip branch builds ffmpeg for the multi-tip branch of phorton1/chromaprint.


Please see the other multi branches **multi-0.9** and **multi-0.11** for additional version specific builds.

This FFmpeg codebase remains mainly LGPL-licensed with optional components licensed under GPL. Please refer to the LICENSE file for detailed information.
